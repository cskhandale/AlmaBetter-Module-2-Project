## Capstone EDA Project

### Overview
Airbnb, an influential online marketplace that facilitates connections between property hosts and prospective tenants, spans more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries globally. This project focuses on New York City (NYC) in 2019, a year when the city attracted an impressive 66.6 million visitors. The primary objective is to conduct a thorough analysis of Airbnb's dataset for NYC, recognizing the pivotal role data plays in the company's operations. By applying fundamental exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we scrutinize the distribution of listings based on various factors, such as location, pricing, room types, and more.

NYC, as a quintessential global destination, stands out for its cultural and commercial prominence and is a top choice for Airbnb users. The dataset provides a rich source of information, which we dissect from multiple perspectives to unveil insights into listings distribution according to location, price ranges, room types, and other relevant parameters. This comprehensive examination equips Airbnb's marketing, finance, and technical teams with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
